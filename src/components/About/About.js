        In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk,
        usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition
        of a tree may be narrower, including only wood plants with secondary
        growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified
        height.
